      <p>
        Welcome to English Friendly Korea! Our mission is to make life easier for English-speaking expatriates and tourists navigating South Korea. We understand that language barriers and cultural differences can sometimes be challenging, and finding reliable services that cater to English speakers is paramount.
      </p>
      <p>
        This platform was born out of a desire to create a comprehensive, community-driven directory of businesses, clinics, and various services that are known to be welcoming and accessible to the international community. Whether you're looking for a doctor who speaks your language, a restaurant with an English menu, or a specialty store, we aim to be your go-to resource.
      </p>
      
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Our Vision</h2>
      <p>
        We envision a South Korea where language is never a barrier to accessing essential services or enjoying the rich cultural experiences the country has to offer. By curating and sharing information about English-friendly establishments, we hope to foster a more inclusive and supportive environment for foreigners.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">How We Curate Listings</h2>
      <p>
        Our listings are gathered through a combination of community recommendations, direct outreach to businesses, and thorough online research. We prioritize accuracy and relevance, striving to ensure that each listing genuinely offers a positive experience for English speakers. While we do our best, we also rely on our users to help us keep information up-to-date. If you have a suggestion or find an error, please don't hesitate to contact us!
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Join Our Community</h2>
      <p>
        English Friendly Korea is more than just a directory; it's a community effort. We encourage you to share your experiences, recommend new places (using our upcoming "Submit a Listing" feature!), and provide feedback to help us grow and improve. Together, we can build the most helpful resource for English speakers in Korea.
